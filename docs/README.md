# Basic to Advanced Python Learning  with Indu 

This project primarily aims at providing the solutions to the data structure and algorithm problems using cPython programming language. We cover python in-built data structures , data structure and algorithms extensively in this repository. Also, we are going to provide the pythonic solutions to common software design problems. .
All the code written here are simple,concise, clean and follows Pep-8 standard.

## How to Progress Learning

I recommend you to learn in the following sequence:
* [python language](https://github.com/Indu-sharma/python-data_structure-algorithms/tree/master/python_language)
* [design patterns](https://github.com/Indu-sharma/python-data_structure-algorithms/tree/master/python_design_patterns)
* [data structure](https://github.com/Indu-sharma/python-data_structure-algorithms/tree/master/python_data_structure)
* [algorithms](https://github.com/Indu-sharma/python-data_structure-algorithms/tree/master/python_algorithms)
* [pytest](https://github.com/Indu-sharma/python-data_structure-algorithms/tree/master/pytest)
* [python for bigdata](https://github.com/Indu-sharma/python-data_structure-algorithms/tree/master/python_bigdata)




### Prerequisites
I recommend to install following software in your system:
* python 3.7.x or Higher 
* pip3 to install python 3 software modules and packages. 
* Pycharm - Community Version (if you want free) 


### Installing


```
pip3 install -r docs/requirements.txt
git clone git@github.com:Indu-sharma/python-data_structure-algorithms.git
```


## Running the tests

TBD



### And coding style 

All the code checked-in should follow PEP-8 standards. 

```
1. If you are using Pycharm, turn the PEP-8 syntax checks and correct using format
   (yellow bulb appears by default) before commiting the code. 
2. Try to write the code in more Pythonic way. 
   Ex- you may use list comrehension against for loop if possible or Lambda functions. 
```
