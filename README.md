# Python-3 Learning with Indu 

This project aims at providing the Python-2/3 codes for Python in-built data structure , data structure and algorithms. 
All the code written here are simple, clean and follows Pep-8 standard.

## How to Progress Learning

You need to learn in the following sequence:
* [python language](#python language)
* [python data structure](#python data structure)
* [python algorithms](#python algorithms)
* [pytest framework](#pytest framework)
* [python bigdata](#python bigdata)




### Prerequisites
I recommend to install following software in your system:
* python 3.7.x or Higher 
* pip3 to install python 3 software modules and packages. 


### Installing


```
git clone git@github.com:Indu-sharma/python-data_structure-algorithms.git
```


## Running the tests

TBD



### And coding style tests

All the code checked-in should follow PEP-8 standards. 

```
TBD
